== 0.1.7 2009-11-23 ("Conferencia Rails'09 & Gemcutter moving" Release
* Removed path_to method sensitivity: if present, ignored (uses url_mappings)
* README_es: MP philososy and its pros and cons
* New step definition to add/edit nested attributes (out of the box!)
* Improvements in some spanish matchers:
  * I see the text WITHIN a selector
  * I follow the link WITHIN a selector
  * Four step definitions share "page interpretation" logic through
   url_mappings. Those steps definitions are:
    * I see the link
    * I follow the link
    * I visit the page
    * I should be in the page
   Page interpretation includes:
    * the index page of a resource
    * the creation page of a resource
    * the edition page of a resource
    * the page of an specific resource (through its "name")
    * the page of a mentioned resource
    * a page relavite to the current one (next or previous)
    * a specific path/url optionally written with a natural name
* 2 new english matchers:
  * When I visit the page
  * Then I see the text
* 1 IMPORTANT behaviour CHANGED:
  * If a given resource has not been mentioned in the scenario, MP tries to
    get it from DB.
* Generators include some page mapping (url_mappings) examples
* Added support to assign at a has_many field which asociated belongs_to has
  not the name of the model
* Bunch of bugfixes to celebrate RConf!

* 1 new step definition w/ es_ES matcher:

  * 'name' is the literal to map for 'the name field' of a model ('nombre' is
    now deprecated)
* README_es improvements:
  * MundoPepino philosofy added,
  * Sections swapping (to give more relevance to steps definitions than to
    dependendies)

* Fixed bug in children search if their name field it's not "name" (by Paco

  * Resource at BBDD should have an specific number of children (Paco Guzman's
    issue)
